CONTEXT

I wanted a way of managing backlinks in my markdown notes when I
converted them to HTML. I came across someone who wanted to do the exact
same thing so I thought I'd take their code as a starting point and
re-write it so that it works the way I want.

The code I started from:

The CSS:

USAGE

There are a few variables at the top of the Makefile that you will need
to modify before running doing anything:

  MARKDOWN_FILES_LOCATION
  BACKLINKS_TEMP_FOLDER
  HTML_FOLDER

Once you've made the changes in the Makefile, all you need to do is run
the `gen` target to generate a static site (with backlinks between pages
where needed) from your markdown notes:

  make gen

If you're happy with the results, copy the HTML files onto your web
server and delete the ones that are on your machine using:

  make clean

...and that should be all.
