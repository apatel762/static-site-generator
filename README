To generate a static web page using the notes in this folder, do:

  make gen

to generate a static site using the example markdown files that are 
included in the repo.

CONTEXT

I wanted a way of managing backlinks in my markdown notes when I

same thing so I thought I'd take their code as a starting point and
re-write it so that it works the way I want.

The code I started from:
