To get this running, do:

  make install

and then try:

  make gen

to generate a static site using the example markdown files that are
included in the repo.

TODO: Markdown notes shouldn't have to be in the repo folder, the html
generator should work no matter where the notes are stored.

TODO: Generated backlinks files should go to a temp folder as they are
deleted every run.

TODO: Dark theme.

TODO: Generate an index.html file (after everything else) which contains
a literal index of every single note. It may be useful to separate some
of the python code into a util.py file so it can be re-used in the
script which generates the index.html file. This file should be
generated after everything else so that it doesnt pollute the backlinks.
